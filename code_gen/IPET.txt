 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.0 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 5, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 2 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 0 by density.
       ... on average 2.5 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 17 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The maximum B&B level was 1, 0.1x MIP order, 1 at the optimal solution.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 1, with a dynamic range of 1.
      Time to load data was 0.001 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
